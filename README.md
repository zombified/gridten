Grid Ten is my entry for the 27th [Ludum Dare](http://ludumdare.com) 48-hour 
game development competition. The theme of the competition was '10 Seconds'.


From my [entry description page](http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-27/?action=preview&uid=7263):

The goal of Grid Ten is to protect the green dot from the cyan and redish/purplish ones.

You can select junctions and then add objects that force the cyan dots to move in specific directions, and you can also add blocks that destroy cyan dots instantly.

You get points every 10 seconds. These points are both your score and a type of currency for being able to place objects on the grid.

There are also more things in the game (behind the scenes) that relate to 10 or 10 seconds -- like that the grid is 10x10.

The rest of the instructions are on the game's webpage.

Only tested on Chrome 29 and FF (22 and 25.0a2).

* Known Issues:
  - sounds occasionally get louder the more often they are played, and so audio is muted by default.
